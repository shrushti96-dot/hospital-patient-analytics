# Healthcare Data Analytics â€“ Mini Project (Data Engineering)

This repository contains my mini project for **Assignment 1.1 (Unit 1: Experiential Learning & Case Study)** of the **Data Engineering** course.  
It demonstrates the **data lifecycle** (Capture â†’ Store â†’ Clean â†’ Analyze â†’ Visualize) using a healthcare admissions dataset.  

---

## Repository Contents
- **Documentation (PDF)** â†’ Assignment report (Q1: Research, Q2: Case Study, Conclusion).  
- **Dataset (CSV)** â†’ `healthcare_dataset_1000.csv` (raw data) and `cleaned_healthcare_dataset.csv`.  
- **Python Scripts** â†’ Data cleaning and analysis (`src/analyze.py`).  
- **Outputs** â†’ Visualizations, cleaned dataset, and summary CSVs (`outputs/`).

## Dataset Information
- **File:** `healthcare_dataset_1000.csv`  
- **Records:** 1000+ patients  
- **Fields:**  
  - PatientID  
  - Age  
  - Gender  
  - Disease  
  - AdmissionDate  
  - DischargeDate  
  - TreatmentCost  
  - Outcome

## Data Lifecycle (Steps Followed)
1. **Capture** â†’ Patient admission data collected in CSV format.  
2. **Store** â†’ Dataset stored as CSV, similar to how hospitals use databases/EHR systems.  
3. **Clean** â†’ Missing values filled (Age â†’ median, Gender â†’ Unknown, Disease â†’ Not Specified, TreatmentCost â†’ average), duplicates removed.  
4. **Analyze** â†’ Identified most common diseases, treatment cost distribution, age groups, and gender ratio.  
5. **Visualize** â†’ Imported into **Power BI** and created interactive charts:  
   - Bar Chart â†’ Disease frequency  
   - Column Chart â†’ Average treatment cost by disease  
   - Pie Chart â†’ Gender distribution  
   - Histogram â†’ Age distribution  
   - Line Chart â†’ Monthly admissions trend

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** â†’ Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for preprocessing and basic charts)  
- **Power BI** â†’ Final visualization dashboards  
- **GitHub** â†’ Version control and project sharing  

---

## Key Insights
- Flu and Diabetes were the most common diseases.  
- Cardiac cases had the highest treatment costs.  
- Majority of patients were between 40â€“60 years.  
- Slightly more male patients than female.  
- Admissions peaked in February and June (seasonal trend).

## Conclusion
This project highlights how raw hospital admission data can be converted into **actionable insights** using data engineering techniques. Hospitals can use such analysis for better **resource planning, budgeting, and improving patient care**.
